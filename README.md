#My First Blog

With this page I have setup functions to store user input into arrays, as well as update the arrays as new input is added.
The values are stored in local storage and then retrieved and displayed on the second page in the categories associated with their values.
I also have setup and button to change the display modes between day mode and night mode.
There is also a functional back button that will take the user back to the main page to enter more data.
