My First Blog
- With this page I have setup functions to store user input into arrays, as well as update the arrays as new input is added.
- The values are stored in local storage and then retrieved and displayed on the second page in the categories associated with their values.
- I also have setup and button to change the display modes between day mode and night mode.
- There is also a functional back button that will take the user back to the main page to enter more data.
